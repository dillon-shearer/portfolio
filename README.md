## Projects
#### 2022 SAIPE Estimates Analysis
- **Objective**: Analyze and visualize Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE).
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Methodology**: Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and geospatial analysis.
- **Key Findings**:
##### National Analysis

Poverty Rate: The national poverty rate in 2022 was 12.6%, affecting 40,951,625 individuals.
Child Poverty Rate: Significantly higher at 16.3%, impacting 11,582,950 children.
Median Household Income: $74,755, highlighting economic conditions for the typical American household.

##### State Analysis

Poverty Percentage: Varies across states, with an average of 12.36%. The lowest is 7.4% and the highest is 19.2%.
Median Income Relationship: An inverse relationship between median income and poverty rates. States like MS, LA, WV, and AR have high poverty and low median incomes, while NH, MD, NJ, and HI have low poverty and high incomes.

##### Insights and Actions

Targeted Programs: High poverty states may benefit from enhanced federal assistance and job training programs.
Income Disparity: Areas like DC, with high income and high poverty, need analysis of income disparities and cost of living.
Economic Development: Initiatives to attract businesses and improve infrastructure can aid low-income states.
Healthcare and Education: Investments in these areas can improve long-term economic outcomes.
Customized Policies: Tailor economic policies to state-specific challenges rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.
