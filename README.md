# Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my data analytics portfolio! This repository contains a collection of my projects and case studies in data analytics, along with descriptions of my skills and experience in this field.

## About Me

I am a data scientist with experience in machine learning, data visualization, and big data technologies. I have a strong background in mathematics and statistics, and I am passionate about using data to solve complex problems and drive business value.

## Skills

- Machine learning: I have experience with a wide range of machine learning algorithms, including supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning, and natural language processing.
- Data visualization: I have expertise in using visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to create compelling and informative visualizations of data.
- Big data technologies: I am familiar with big data technologies such as Apache Spark, Hadoop, and NoSQL databases, and I have experience working with large and complex datasets.

## Projects

- **Predicting Customer Churn**: In this project, I built and evaluated a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. I used a gradient boosting algorithm and feature engineering techniques to improve the model's performance, and I achieved an AUC of 0.86 on the test set.
- **Analyzing Airline Delays**: In this project, I used data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics to analyze the causes and impacts of airline delays. I created interactive visualizations using Plotly to explore the data, and I identified key factors that contribute to delays, such as weather and carrier performance.
- **Predicting Housing Prices**: In this project, I used a regression model to predict housing prices in the city of Boston. I cleaned and preprocessed the data using Pandas, and I trained and evaluated the model using scikit-learn. I achieved an R-squared of 0.75 on the test set.
